Generate static HTML files from the sitemap of any dynamic website.

# Sample Use Case
* If you CMS sucks, use few rules of HTTRACK and generate static files to host with your CDN.

PS: Might not be useful for everyone, but I am using this deployment method, where the CMS uploads the static / media contents automatically to the CDN provider, and this script generates the HTML.

Let me know if it works for you as well.
